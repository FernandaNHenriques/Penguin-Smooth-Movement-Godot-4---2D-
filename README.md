Penguin Smooth Movement (Godot 4)

This is a small technical prototype created to study smooth 2D character movement in Godot 4.
The goal was to implement acceleration, deceleration, responsive jumping, and controlled gravity using CharacterBody2D.

⚠ The artwork was not created by me.
All sprites are temporary placeholders — the focus of this project is entirely on the movement code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Study and implement:

  *Smooth acceleration when running
  
  *Soft deceleration when releasing input
  
  *Custom friction and momentum
  
  *Responsive jump
  
  *Gravity tuning for natural feel
  
  *Non-instant velocity changes (no “snappy” movement)

A simple but important building block for any platformer: making the character feel good to control.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main Concepts

  *lerp() for horizontal smoothing
  
  *Speed ramping
  
  *Custom friction for soft stops
  
  *Simple jump with tuned gravity
  
  *Delta-based movement for consistent physics

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not a full game — just a focused movement study to support future gameplay and tech art development.

Built With: Godot Engine 4.3 -> GDScript
